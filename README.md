## input_data

There's a `.gitignore`'d folder called `input_data` which has the same folder structure as the `src` folder.

The contents of each "day" folder looks like this:

- `puzzle.txt`: The puzzle input.
- `puzzle_answer_1.txt`: The first answer for the puzzle.
- `puzzle_answer_2.txt`: The second answer for the puzzle.
- `puzzle_example.txt`: The example puzzle input.
- `puzzle_example_answer_1.txt`: The first answer for the example puzzle.
- `puzzle_example_answer_2.txt`: The second answer for the example puzzle.
